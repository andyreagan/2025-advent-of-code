# 2025 Advent of Code

My solutions in Rust.

## Running

For a full run you need the inputs.
I have them as a private submodule,
so just 

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:andyreagan/advent-of-code.git
cargo run
```

Puzzle inputs go in `inputs/day01.txt`, `inputs/day02.txt`, etc.

## Testing

Run the tests with

```
cargo test
```
